## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the ZenPlay repository from GitHub:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/silomaben/zenplay.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment:

```

Activate the virtual environment:
```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure the Project
1. Copy the `.env.example` file (if available) to `.env`:
   ```cmd
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file and set the required environment variables:
   ```env
   SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
   DEBUG=True
   DATABASE_URL=<your-database-connection-string>
   ```

3. Ensure the database credentials match your local setup.

### Step 5: Apply Database Migrations
Run the following commands to prepare the database:
```cmd
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
